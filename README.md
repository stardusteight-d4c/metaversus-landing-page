# Metaversus | Next.js 13 & Framer Motion

![banner](banner.png)

> Project for the construction of a leaning page carried out on the `JavaScript Mastery` channel, where he was taught how to incorporate a `Figma` layout 
> into the a `React` code (library to create user interfaces in web pages) using the `Next.js 13` framework (production ready framework that
> enables hybrid rendering (static and server-side), TypeScript support, smart packaging, route prefetching for web apps based on React). 
> In this project we use good practices for creating web interfaces, how to deal with static files, constants and how to separate responsibilities 
> with organizing directories for front-end applications. In addition to these modern technologies that we have on the market, we use the package
> `Framer Motion` which is also a modern solution for creating simple and sophisticated linear animations.
